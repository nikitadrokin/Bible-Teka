# Bible Structure and Canonical Order

## Overview
The Bible data structure follows the Russian Synodal translation canonical order, which differs from the typical Protestant order used in American translations.

## Key Requirements

### Russian Synodal Canon Order
- The Bible books must be ordered according to the Russian Orthodox Synodal translation
- Both English and Russian book arrays should follow the same canonical sequence
- The New Testament order specifically places the Catholic Epistles (James, Peter, John, Jude) before the Pauline Epistles

### Book Naming Conventions
- Russian names should follow the traditional Synodal translation terminology
- English names should be standard but ordered to match the Synodal sequence
- Maintain consistency in naming patterns (e.g., "От Матфея" vs "Евангелие от Матфея")

### Data Structure
- Each book maintains: id, name, chapters count
- IDs should be sequential following the canonical order
- Chapter counts must be accurate for each book

### Implementation Notes
- The src/data/bible.ts file contains both English and Russian book arrays
- Both arrays must be synchronized in their ordering
- Any changes to book order must update both language versions simultaneously

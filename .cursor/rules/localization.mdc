# Localization

This file documents the localization implementation for the BibleTeka application.

## Requirements

- Support for English and Russian languages
- Ability to switch between languages via UI
- Persist language preference
- Translate all UI text

## Implementation

1. Created a Zustand store (`locale-store.ts`) to manage and persist the selected locale
2. Set up i18n configuration with react-i18next in `lib/i18n.ts`
3. Created a LocaleSwitcher component for toggling between languages
4. Added synchronization between the Zustand store and i18n
5. Integrated the LocaleSwitcher in the main UI
6. Added translations for all UI text in both English and Russian

## Translations

The following text elements have been translated:
- App title ("BibleTeka" / "БиблиоТека")
- Bible navigation labels ("Select a Book", "Select a Chapter", etc.)
- Testament labels ("Old Testament", "New Testament")
- Audio player error messages
- Language switcher labels

## Next Steps

1. Consider translating Bible book names if needed
2. Add more languages in the future if needed
3. Ensure any new UI elements use the translation function

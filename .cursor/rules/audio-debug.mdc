# Audio Player Debugging

## Current Issue
- Audio player not auto-playing on iPhone Safari (website, not PWA)
- Need debugging statements to diagnose iOS autoplay policy issues

## Debug Implementation
- Add debug paragraph above audio element in AudioPlayer component
- Show audio loading states, autoplay attempts, and errors
- Avoid prop drilling by keeping debug info internal to component
- Display current audio state and browser autoplay policies

## Technical Details
- iOS has strict autoplay policies requiring user interaction
- Need to track canplaythrough events and autoplay failures
- Show real-time status of audio loading and playback attempts

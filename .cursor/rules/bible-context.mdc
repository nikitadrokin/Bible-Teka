# Bible Context Race Condition Fix

## Problem
- Before client hydrates, UI shows English text
- Then flashes to Russian when locale hydrates
- Then tries to set previously listened chapter
- Race condition: searches for Russian book ID in English locale, or vice versa
- Results in incorrect book selection or failed lookups

## Solution
- Wait for both locale store and history store to hydrate before initializing
- Coordinate the hydration of both stores
- Only initialize from last listened chapter after both stores are ready
- Ensure correct locale books are used when finding the book by ID

## Implementation âœ… COMPLETED
- Check both `useLocaleStore.persist.hasHydrated()` and `useHistoryStore.persist.hasHydrated()`
- Only run initialization logic when both are hydrated
- Use the hydrated locale to get the correct books array
- Find book by ID in the correct locale's books array

## Changes Made
- Updated initialization useEffect to wait for both stores to hydrate
- Updated history tracking useEffect to wait for both stores to hydrate
- Prevents race condition where wrong locale books are used for book lookup
- Ensures smooth user experience without flashing between locales

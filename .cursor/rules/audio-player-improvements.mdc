# Audio Player iOS Autoplay Improvements

## Current Challenge
iOS has strict autoplay policies that prevent audio from playing automatically without user interaction. The current implementation tracks user interaction budget and attempts direct `audio.play()` calls.

## Improved Solution
Instead of calling `audio.play()` directly, programmatically click the play button element. This approach:

1. Creates a ref to the play button element
2. Uses `button.click()` instead of `audio.play()` for autoplay attempts
3. iOS might treat the programmatic button click as a legitimate user gesture
4. Could bypass autoplay budget limitations more effectively

## Implementation Details
- Add `playButtonRef` to reference the play button
- Modify `triggerIOSAutoplay` function to click the button instead of calling audio.play()
- Maintain existing debug tracking for comparison
- Keep fallback mechanisms in place

## Expected Benefits
- Better iOS autoplay success rate
- More natural interaction pattern
- Potentially bypass autoplay budget restrictions
- Maintain compatibility with other browsers

# Bible Audio Project

This project is a web application that allows users to browse and listen to Bible audio chapters.

## Features
- Bible book and chapter selection
- Audio playback of selected chapters
- API proxy to fetch audio files from external source

## Current Issue
- Audio files are not being fetched properly from the proxy API
- The HEAD request to /api/audio/$book/$chapter.mp3 is returning 405 Method Not Allowed
- Need to fix the API route handling for HEAD requests

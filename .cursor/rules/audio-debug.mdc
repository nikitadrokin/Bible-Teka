# Audio Player Debugging

## Current Issue - SOLVED!
- Audio player not auto-playing on iPhone Safari (website, not PWA)
- **ROOT CAUSE**: iOS Safari stops loading audio after metadata to save bandwidth/battery
- Only loads actual audio data when user explicitly triggers playback

## Debug Implementation
- Add debug paragraph above audio element in AudioPlayer component
- Show audio loading states, autoplay attempts, and errors
- Avoid prop drilling by keeping debug info internal to component
- Display current audio state and browser autoplay policies

## Technical Details
- iOS has strict autoplay policies requiring user interaction
- **KEY FINDING**: iOS stops at NETWORK_IDLE/HAVE_METADATA until manual play trigger
- After manual play: progresses to HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA and buffers entire file
- Need to programmatically trigger loading instead of waiting for auto-load

## Solution Implementation
- Detect when audio stops at metadata-loaded state on iOS
- Programmatically trigger audio.load() or change preload strategy
- Use iOS-friendly approach: trigger loading, then auto-play
- Work with iOS behavior rather than against it

## Next Steps
- Add more granular debugging for audio loading events
- Check network loading, buffering progress, and error states
- Investigate iOS-specific audio loading restrictions
- Monitor src changes and loading progression

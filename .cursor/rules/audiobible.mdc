# Bible Audio Project

This project is a web application that allows users to browse and listen to Bible audio chapters.

## Features
- Bible book and chapter selection
- Audio playback of selected chapters
- tRPC-based API for fetching audio files from external source

## Implementation
- Using tRPC v11 for type-safe API calls
- Direct GET requests for audio files instead of HEAD checks
- External audio source: https://4bbl.ru/data/syn-kozlov
- Component architecture with separate components for different UI sections
- State management with React hooks and Zustand for shared state

## Current Work
- Refactoring the main page component into smaller, reusable components
- Splitting the UI sections into logical components:
  - BookSelector
  - ChapterSelector
  - AudioSection
  - BibleInfo

## Current Issue
- Audio files are not being fetched properly from the proxy API
- The HEAD request to /api/audio/$book/$chapter.mp3 is returning 405 Method Not Allowed
- Need to fix the API route handling for HEAD requests

## Latest Task
- Modify book selection behavior to automatically select chapter 1 when a book is chosen
- Ensure that audio starts preloading and playing immediately after book selection
- Update BibleContext.tsx to manage this new selection flow
- Update index.tsx to properly handle the modified context behavior

# Audio Player Debugging

## Current Issue
- Audio player not auto-playing on iPhone Safari (website, not PWA)
- **DIAGNOSIS**: Audio gets stuck at "metadata-loaded" state and never reaches "canplay"
- This prevents autoplay from even being attempted

## Debug Implementation
- Add debug paragraph above audio element in AudioPlayer component
- Show audio loading states, autoplay attempts, and errors
- Avoid prop drilling by keeping debug info internal to component
- Display current audio state and browser autoplay policies

## Technical Details
- iOS has strict autoplay policies requiring user interaction
- Need to track canplaythrough events and autoplay failures
- Show real-time status of audio loading and playback attempts
- **FINDING**: Audio loading stops after metadata, never reaches canplay state

## Next Steps
- Add more granular debugging for audio loading events
- Check network loading, buffering progress, and error states
- Investigate iOS-specific audio loading restrictions
- Monitor src changes and loading progression
